            <h2>About Me🤓🙌</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Armand, a passionate software developer in training. I started coding because I wanted to create interactive websites 
                and software applications that solve real problems. I’m persistent, curious, and eager to learn new technologies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy problem-solving, creating projects from scratch, and learning cutting-edge technologies. My goal is to become a 
                skilled software developer capable of delivering high-quality solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am motivated to grow as a developer and pursue a career where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuously 
                improving my skills.
